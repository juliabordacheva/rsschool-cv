 ### About me

 From 2007 to the present, I have been working as a sound engineer. I h've made soundtrack for over 100 feature films and tv-series. During the lockdown due to the covid-19 pandemic, I stopped working for a while and got carried away with front-end development. For me, it was a great way to not get depressed during the lockdown and keep my intellectual abilities in top shape. Now I would like to study frontend development more deeply and start working in a new specialty
